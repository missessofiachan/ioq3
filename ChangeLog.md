### 2002-9-30 Timothee Besset [ttimo@idsoftware.com](mailto:ttimo@idsoftware.com)

* ATVI Quake 3 1.32 Patch #9
rolling back to the way it was before, leaving 1v1 force vote exploit, the fix was worse than the bug
from comment on bug #9 in tracker:

&#x09;actually the fix is worse than the original bug

&#x20;    after the fix, voting when you are alone on the server was no longer working
it was kinda intended in the fix, that you would have to be at least two to pass a vote .. but
it is an oversight.

&#x20;    calling a vote in a 1v1 game against a bot fails immediately
     (calling a vote in any situation where there's only 1 live player fails)

     Say a server's running some lame custom map that you have but a friend doesn't. You can't go
     on the server and change it to the map you want to play, so he ends up having to auto-dl it at
     8K a second just so you can switch from it.

     This particular 2 clients, vote / quit exploit would involve too many changes to fix properly.
     I am reverting back to the old version, and leaving as WNF

some bug fixes require protocol change, or mod code/mod interface change to be fixed properly
this is a biz decision, dunno yet if we are going to want a new protocol (probably not)
-> have to create a branch for the 1.31b, i.e. backwards compatible with 1.31 'Stable-1\_31'
and put the 1.32 specific / protocol changes on trunk
no telling what will go in SOS in the end .. probably 1.32

### 2001-02-20  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* CVS: update, then tag current version as

\\\* SOS: patched up to sos010219.

\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/cm\\\\\\\_trace.c (CM\\\\\\\_Trace): fabs on sphere offsets (SOS).

	\\\\\\\* code/botlib/be\\\\\\\_aas\\\\\\\_cluster.c: enabled LogWrites, different flood (SOS).

	\\\\\\\* SOS: patching up to snapshot sos010219. 
	Note: For brevity, I use as marker sosYYMMDD now instead of bkYYMMDD, to 
	distinguish from changes not in SOS.

	\\\\\\\*  CVS: tagged current version before patching up with SOS.

\* code/server/sv\_init.c: DLL\_ONLY sets sv\_pure to 0 and ROM.
TODO: determine good sv\_pure policy for DLL-only servers.

\\\* code/renderer/tr\\\_shade\\\_calc.c: my\\\_ftol implementation (BSD).

\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile: FreeBSD sections.

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/unix\\\\\\\_glw.h: guard #error
	\\\\\\\* code/unix/linux\\\\\\\_snd.c: soundcard.h location (BSD).
	\\\\\\\* code/unix/linux\\\\\\\_glimp.c: guard system headers.
	Later: added Joystick stubs.
	Note: linux\\\\\\\_ etc. prefixes start to loose meaning as we
	re-use most of this on UNIXes anyway. I didn't use Raf's
	freebsd\\\\\\\_joystick.c but instead put generic stubs here.
	TODO: introduce generic -DNO\\\\\\\_JOYSTICK flag.
	\\\\\\\* code/renderer/tr\\\\\\\_local.h: my\\\\\\\_ftol guard.

### 2001-02-15  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/unix/Makefile: BSD related changes.
\* code/cgame/cg\_draw.c: hacked phone jack rendering check for Debug.
TODO: finish Debug, fix CG\_DrawDisconnect !!!

\\\* code/unix/vm\\\_x86.c: error on compile attempts. Fight redundancy!
\\\* code/qcommon/vm\\\_x86.c (VM\\\_CallCompiled): dummy for linkage on PPC.
Note: DLL\\\_ONLY is the global Makefile option for DLL-only builts.
Currently only executed on Linux.
\\\* code/unix/unix\\\_main.c: \\\*ppc postfix for DLLs. Ignored the changes
to redundant code (have to remove the unused Un/LoadDll/API calls).
\\\* code/server/sv\\\_game.c (VMA): changed macro (see below). PPC.
\\\* code/qcommon/vm.c (VM\\\_DllSyscall): see lengthy commentary by Ryan.
The existing VM code makes certain assumptions about the layout of
varargs on the stack, which fall apart with call conventions that
don't even put all parameters on the stack (gcc on PPC, register-rich).
Using a dedicated memory area as our own stack. This should actually
be the default behavior.
Later: make vm\\\_\\\* cvars INIT/ROM for DLL\\\_ONLY target.

\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/common.c: PPC change (from Ryan Gordon).










### 2001-02-07  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

	\\\\\\\* Win32: can't get an unadulterated SOS snapshot to build.
	First, fix CR/LF back again (Linux client converts all).
	 find . -name '\\\\\\\*.ds\\\\\\\*' -print
	 alias dos2unix='recode ibmpc..lat1' 
	 alias unix2dos='recode lat1..ibmpc'
        Next, find a \\\\\\\*.dws that works? Nope, no cigar.

\* CVS: checking in preparation for Beta2.
cvs tag id1-27h-loki010116-beta2

\\\* SOS: new bspc "2.1e". No change on 1.27h.

\\\\\\\* TEST: patch-up seems to work fine. No new files have been added
	to the linkage (i.e. the ft2/ files now added), so we might not be
	feature complete.

	\\\\\\\* code/game/g\\\\\\\_active.c (ClientThink\\\\\\\_real): id MISSIONPACK
	conditional in addition to the ones I added earlier.
	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/files.c: REJECT. Linux hack for userdir threw it off.

beta released, the second one was post release. Beware
of source files added and removed (botlib headers, FT2).
Note: why so late? Don't ask...





### 2001-01-08  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* SOS: id's working up to 1.27h (server side fix for
Guard exploit seems to force earlier release). Updating
CVS (most of the changes are debug code put in and
then disabled, plus some fixes as below). Next patching
up to current SOS.



### 2001-01-07  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* Makefile: need to rework this for multiple platforms.
We also need null/null\_vm.c for platforms where we don't
have JIT (assembly emit).



### 2001-01-04  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/q3\_ui/ui\_connect.c (UI\_DisplayDownloadInfo): time
information for current (vs. start of download) is wrong,
thus negative 1 "estimated time", as well as transfer
rate just negative downloadSize. Not fixed.

\\\* code/unix/unix\\\_main.c (Sys\\\_ParseArgs): added.
Note: for support/us, to identify builts. This is only
a skeleton right now - if I ever feel the need to support
more than "-v" and "--version" I'll have to flesh this out.

\\\\\\\* code/unix/linux\\\\\\\_glimp.c (signal\\\\\\\_handler): see below.
	\\\\\\\* code/unix/unix\\\\\\\_main.c (Sys\\\\\\\_Exit): added an abstraction
	layer for exit/\\\\\\\_exit/assert/raise issues.
	Note: need both a better debug/backtrace handling, and
	have to find a way to determine why/where the alleged
	startup/exit errors happen...










### 2001-01-03  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/game/g\_mem.c (G\_Alloc): ERR\_DROP initiated by
addbot commands for large sv\_maxclients, allegedly
caused segfaults in 1.17. Not reproducible.
TODO: recover more gracefully from failure to add bot?

\\\* code/renderer/tr\\\_light.c (R\\\_LightForPoint): Tim Angus
reports a crashbug with nolight maps. Also assertion in
R\\\_SetupEntityLightingGrid, might want conditional there.
DONE: fixed crash on LightForPoint for nolight maps.

\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/qcommon.h: NUM\\\\\\\_SERVER\\\\\\\_PORTS. A feature 
	request to increase this, or make it more flexible
	otherwise (Fenris).
	TODO: id decision on more flexible NUM\\\\\\\_SERVER\\\\\\\_PORTS.










### 2001-01-02  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/unix/snapvector.nasm: fixed FPU bit (the current
one had reserved bits off, behavior should not change).
\* code/qcommon/vm\_x86.c: fixed symbols (below).
\* code/unix/ftol.nasm: FPU bits weren't correct (duh).
DONE: shoot-though floor (q3dm5)
DONE: cursor-in-rect off  (TA/Player model selection)
Note: in gdb, "disassemble \<funcname>" is your friend.

\\\* code/cgame/cg\\\_public.h:  CG\\\_MEMSET is set to 100. In
cg\\\_syscalls.asm it's 101. If I change it I get Bad trap 100
from the cgame VM code, so the 1.27g "official" VM code
uses it.

\\\\\\\* code/unix/linux\\\\\\\_common.c: have to fall back to C, the
	current assembly is buggy...
	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile (linux\\\\\\\_common.o): added.
	Later: also for dedicated. Less portable this way.
	TODO: C\\\\\\\_ONLY for dedicated on non-i386 only?

	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/common.c: do not use memcpy/memset under Linux.
	\\\\\\\* code/unix/linux\\\\\\\_common.c: added Andrew's assembly port.
	TODO: C\\\\\\\_ONLY for Com\\\\\\\_Memset/Memcpy? Conditionals are fubared.

	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/vm.c (VM\\\\\\\_Init): use Win32 defaults (do not
	use DLL's by default). This exposes DLL rounding errors
	(damage through floors), and we don't want DLL's used by
	default anyway.
	TODO: why vm\\\\\\\_ui default of 1?

	\\\\\\\* code/botlib/l\\\\\\\_precomp.c (SourceWarning): removed assert.

	\\\\\\\* code/game/bg\\\\\\\_lib.c (acos): defined, but we don't actually
	use it except where the cg\\\\\\\_syscalls.asm trap is used.

	\\\\\\\* code/game/g\\\\\\\_public.h: missing lots of trap tokens.
	\\\\\\\* code/game/g\\\\\\\_syscalls.c: missing lots of traps.
	\\\\\\\* code/game/g\\\\\\\_syscalls.asm: more inconsistent hooks, were:
	 equ floor					-111
         equ ceil					-112
	 equ testPrintInt			        -113
         equ testPrintFloat			        -114
	now changed to match cg\\\\\\\_syscalls.
	Note: fixed this in UI earlier, how did this slip through 
	the diffs against SOS?
	
	\\\\\\\* code/game/g\\\\\\\_syscalls.c: no acos hook.
	\\\\\\\* code/cgame/cg\\\\\\\_syscalls.c: no acos hook.
	\\\\\\\* code/cgame/cg\\\\\\\_syscalls.asm: has acos hook as -112
	Note: report from Tim Angus. The acos function is in bg\\\\\\\_lib.c
	which is linked only into ui (not q3\\\\\\\_ui). That means we are
	using libc acos right now?
	Note: QVM traps are negative?

	\\\\\\\* BSD/Irix: tagged current CVS (not all of the below) as
	 cvs tag id1-27g-loki010102-bsd1
	for BSD work (Rafael Barrero). Also be used for Irix update.










### 2001-01-01  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* SOS: adding the remaining SOS snapshots to CVS.
cvs import Quake3\_sos sos001201-rc3 pr1-27f-win32-001201-rc3
cvs import Quake3\_sos sos001202 pr1-27f-win32-001202
cvs import Quake3\_sos sos001204 pr1-27g-win32-001204-rc4
This is the codebase to which the Linux branch has been patched
up. I can't verify whether this is identical to the RC4 codebase
as the tag doesn't work (but can check against the ZIP file..)
cvs import Quake3\_sos sos001211 pr1-27g-win32-001211
The above snapshot contains a (post-release?) fix to ui\_syscalls
in ui/ and q3\_ui/. This change has been used in Linux (Beta1 and
above). At this point, id discouraged further use of SOS due to
repository corruption on their end. No further snapshots were
taken since.

\\\* Fenris: since the release of the Beta1 bugs have been
maintained at http://fenris.lokigames.com/. I am going to
list issues here as they get fixed.





### 2000-12-21  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/renderer/tr\_font.c: graceful silence with old mods?
\* code/botlib/l\_precomp.c (SourceWarning): graceful exit if old mod?



### 2000-12-20  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/server/sv\_ccmds.c (SV\_MapRestart\_f): see below.
\* code/qcommon/vm.c: currentVM is 0x0 in VM\_ArgPtr.
In VM\_Call, oldVM was NULL - made conditional the
reset of currentVM to oldVM.



### 2000-12-18  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* BETA1: closed Linux beta release. Stripped debug
and release binaries, DLL's, and pak4.pk3. CVS checkin,
will be tagged as
cvs tag id1-27g-loki001218-beta1
Later: id added a pak5.pk3 to the Win32 point release,
added this to the BETA1 best.

\\\* code/qcommon/vm\\\_x86.c: C37F.
\\\* code/unix/snapvector.nasm: C37F.
Note: short of any real evidence, I gamble and use max.
precision (as well as default Linux precision, but NOT
Win32 precision). It seems that precision change is not
really an issue (despite Graeme's claim that the cursor
in the menu was/is off). I also pick the roundiung behavior
that is seemingly used by ANSI and gcc (but possibly not
Win32 \\\_ftol depending on build).





### 2000-12-15  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/unix/Makefile: added snapvector.o
\* code/unix/unix\_shared.c: #if 0'ed the old snapvector code.
\* code/unix/snapvector.nasm (Sys\_SnapVectorCW): two new
assembly functions from AndrewH that explicitely set the
FPU control word to convert vec3\_t, to ensure cross-platform
behavior for both DLL and QVM.

\\\* code/unix/ftol.nasm (Q\\\_ftolC37F): for globals.

\\\\\\\* code/unix/unix\\\\\\\_main.c: took out global FPU manipulation.
	For clarity this should be VM only.
	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/vm\\\\\\\_x86.c: added prototypes for the ftol
	library. To select a specific behavior for the entire VM,
	set ftolPtr accordingly.
	Later: the GCC ftol function of course affect the stack
	(there is no "declspec naked"). The problem seems to be 
	that the VM never handles the stack in a way compatible 
	to regular gcc C functions. For some odd reason \\\\\\\_ftol seems 
	to do the right thing under Win32. All 4 control words 
	implemented at the moment work just fine with the menus.

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/ftol.nasm: added a small library of "safe" qftol
	variations that explicitely set the control word to the
	relevant (4) possibilities.










### 2000-12-13  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/qcommon/vm\_x86.c: an entire day spent trying to nail
the ftol issues. It breaks down like this: id used to use
an unsafe (no setting FPU control word) fistp. That seemingly
caused subtle physics bugs which nobody cared about in 1.17.
They then changed the UI code, and ran into the UI bugs:
menu entries shifted to the right, fonts vanishing. Then
they switched to using \_ftol. Then they had to reproduce
the old behavior for the physics code due to public outrage.
My original port used a simple (long)float cast, which gcc
seemingly compiles to code that does OR 0C00 on whatever
current control word (precision unchanged). This breaks the
menus. If I use the unprotected fistp instead, which should
(Linux 037F default) use "nearest/even", then my menus are
correct. That would mean Win32 \_ftol in id's compile does
the same, only that would require /qifist or some equivalent
compile flag, which I can't find. Two disassemblies of \_ftol
I got from others showed OR 0C00 as part of the default (ANSI)
behavior.



### 2000-12-13  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/game/bg\_pmove.c (PmoveSingle): trap\_SnapVector.
The one true and single call to snap velocity.
Note: bspc/map.c:void SnapVector(vec3\_t normal)
qcommon/cm\_patch.c:void CM\_SnapVector(vec3\_t normal)
game/q\_shared.h: #define SnapVector(v) {v\[0]=((int)(v\[0]));...

\\\* code/client/cl\\\_cgame.c: CG\\\_SNAPVECTOR.
\\\* code/server/sv\\\_game.c:  G\\\_SNAPVECTOR.
Note: these go through trap\\\_SnapVector in syscalls.

\\\\\\\* code/unix/unix\\\\\\\_shared.c (Sys\\\\\\\_SnapVector): sticking to
	old Linux version for now...
	\\\\\\\* code/win32/win\\\\\\\_shared.c (Sys\\\\\\\_SnapVector): changed.
	Note: Graeme points out this was changed to fix ftol
	artifacts?
	TODO: calculate errors for various ftol variants...

	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/vm\\\\\\\_x86.c: both the old fistp code (1.17)
	and the new qftol function apparatently work. Using the
	ftol.nasm code for now.

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile: DO\\\\\\\_NASM and ftol.o. 

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/ftol.nasm (qftol): created from Mike's SoF
	replacements, with Andrew's help to satify the VM
	stack/call requirements.
	TODO: use Q\\\\\\\_ftol herein to replace myftol elsewhere.

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/unix\\\\\\\_main.c (Sys\\\\\\\_ConfigureFPU): SIGFPE. 
	TODO: divide by zero in botlib. Disable this for now.
	Note: we can't introduce calculation differences between
	versions, so fixing these will have to wait.

	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/vm\\\\\\\_x86.c: two new lines in Win32 branch 
	missing from Linux assembly in AsmCall:
	 mov eax, dword ptr \\\\\\\[edi] 
	 and eax, \\\\\\\[callMask]      
        Added, doesn't seem to affect UI etc. bugs.
	Later: no FTOL\\\\\\\_PTR, use fistp non-IEEE assembly as in old
	version. This seems to work for Q3 and TA, while qftol 
	(simple cast) does not - for Win32 Graeme says the reverse 
	is true.

	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/vm\\\\\\\_x86\\\\\\\_old.c: used the old cvs-1.17 version.
	Two fixes (Hunk\\\\\\\_Alloc, Com\\\\\\\_Memcpy), and it works:
	  +set vm\\\\\\\_game 2 +set vm\\\\\\\_ui 2 +set vm\\\\\\\_cgame 2 
        UI, cgame and game w/o apparent problems.










### 2000-12-12  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/unix/Makefile: cleanup of redundant flags.
Removed bogus MALLOC\_CHECK (note to self: export MALLOC\_CHECK\_=2).  
Also DO\_SHLIB\_CC on all UI DLL's.
Added and removed DEBUG\_VM flag.
TODO: figure out whether Zoid did UI this way intentionally.
Note: this seemingly fixed the botimport problem, although
most of the changes were just redundant CFLAGS removed. Given
our wanker toolchain, should have been more paranoid. All
DLL's can now be used w/o apparent problems.

\\\* code/server/sv\\\_main.c: gvm init.
\\\* code/server/sv\\\_game.c: gvm assertions.
\\\* code/unix/unix\\\_main.c (Sys\\\_LoadDll): print vmMain
Note: top no avail. There is some odd ld/gdb problem here
that prevents examining globals and obfuscates part of
the stack between VM\\\_Call and lower level code, through
G\\\_InitGame. This is not just DLL's being loaded and unloaded.
Wromg flags during build? The vmCvar for "bot\\\_developer"
ends up overlapping global botimport in memory, which
thus zero-fills part of the function pointer table.

\\\\\\\* code/server/sv\\\\\\\_bot.c (SV\\\\\\\_BotInitBotLib): this (by way of
	GetBotLibAPI) is responsible for setting botimport, which,
	if using the game DLL, is not properly set up. Called in
	SV\\\\\\\_Init().

	\\\\\\\* code/game/q\\\\\\\_shared.c: Q\\\\\\\_strncpyz does zero padding (duh).
	Note: calls strncpy, which does a zero fill up to destsize.
	If destsize exceeds memory size, zero padding will overwrite
	adjacent memory. Suspicion was this happened to botimport.

	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/cvar.c: possible problem in Q\\\\\\\_strncpyz call.

	\\\\\\\* code/botlib/be\\\\\\\_ai\\\\\\\_weap.c (weaponinfo\\\\\\\_fields): made this static.
	Note: it seems that the "number" string got replaced by
	 p def.fields\\\\\\\[0]
         {name = 0x40000000 "\\\\\\\\177ELF\\\\\\\\001\\\\\\\\001\\\\\\\\001", offset = 2, type = 50, ..
        Memory corruption?

	\\\\\\\* code/game/inv.h (WEAPONINDEX\\\\\\\_GAUNTLET): defined here. 
	\\\\\\\* botfiles/weapons.c (Gauntlet): the baseq3/qagamei386.so parser
	breaks here:
	 number				WEAPONINDEX\\\\\\\_GAUNTLET
	\\\\\\\* code/botlib/l\\\\\\\_precomp.c (SourceWarning): added assertion to
	trap botlib parsing problem..

	\\\\\\\* RC1: for beta test. Using my own vm/ui.qvm files in this case.
	TODO: Setup with nouninstall.
	TODO: fix game DLL/ botlib setup problem (so all DLL's work)
	TODO: SIGFPE
	TODO: profile?
	
	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile (ai\\\\\\\_vcmd.o): added to game DLL linkage. 
	How the fuck did this happen?
	DONE: "qagamei386.so: undefined symbol: BotVoiceChat\\\\\\\_Defend"

	\\\\\\\* TEST:  +set vm\\\\\\\_ui 2 (vm\\\\\\\_x86, not interpreter). Breaks!
	Further: qagame had undefined, but seemingly gets reloaded 
	second try (I hate the Linux linker).
	\\\\\\\* TODO: never reload fail DLL, abort engine





















### 2000-12-11  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* TEST: recompile QVM/DLL and executable to test new UI code.
The UI QVMs from the paks still do not work.

\\\* SOS: changes in UI code!
\\\* code/q3\\\_ui/ui\\\_public.h: this file is deprecated
Note: e.g. it does not contain the background track calls.
\\\* code/ui/ui\\\_public.h: the uiImport\\\_t enum here determines
the values.
\\\* code/ui/ui\\\_syscalls.asm: same as q3\\\_ui now, were:
equ floor					-111
equ ceil					-112
\\\* code/q3\\\_ui/ui\\\_syscalls.asm: these are now switched, were:
equ trap\\\_S\\\_StartBackgroundTrack			-63
equ trap\\\_S\\\_StopBackgroundTrack				-64
The new values match the ui/ equivalent. Also, floor (-108)
and ceil (-109) are different in ui/.

\\\\\\\* CVS: going to check in this snapshot and tag it as
	    cvs tag id1-27g-loki001209-rc4
	Presumed equivalent to SOS tag "1.27g RC4" (master). As I can't
	obtain the tagged code using SOS (neither Win32 nor Linux client)
	I can only guess.

	\\\\\\\* TEST: use my own VM code, ion baseq3/vm/\\\\\\\*.qvm and missionpack/vm/.
	This works - in other words, the menu bug seems in the UI code, and
	is fixed in my codebase.

	\\\\\\\* TEST: make release. 
	Note: I can postpone DLL specific problems. Bad performance is not
	as important as outright bugs. Thus the UI QVM issue is the only
	one that stops me from creating an RC.
	TODO: Q3 UI QVM code from pak file does not work (neither does TA).
	TODO: sound with video playback still awful. Threaded sound, I guess.
	TODO: ERROR: couldn't open demos/DEMO002.dm3.dm\\\\\\\_48 (same demo001.dm3.dm\\\\\\\_48)
	
	TODO: do not show Q3 demos in TA menu?
	TODO: new demos for Q3? Or at least error message?
	
	\\\\\\\* code/game/bg\\\\\\\_lib.c: itrinsics excluded by Q3\\\\\\\_VM (another -O
	compile). Uninitialized variable.
	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile: -O for uninit on patched code. Also shortcuts. 
	TODO: DC\\\\\\\_ONLY seems an obsolete flag, used in Makefiles, not source.

	\\\\\\\* TEST: +set sv\\\\\\\_pure 0 +set vm\\\\\\\_game 1 +set vm\\\\\\\_cgame 1 +set vm\\\\\\\_ui 0
	Turns out that the pak0.pk3 UI QVM code is seemingly broken in TA
	and Q3, but my UI DLL is not. In reverse, the QVM game/cgame for
	Q3 seems to work quite well (including bots). The TA game/cgame
	also works, including botlib init.
	TODO: BotLib Init using game DLL gives: 
	TODO:  Error: file weapons.c, line 38: unknown structure field number
        TODO:  Fatal: couldn't load the weapon config
        TODO:  Error: BotLoadMap: bot library used before being setup
	
	\\\\\\\* TEST: checked the rc4winstlr.zip CD tree against
	my test install. baseq3/pak4.pl3 and missionpack/pak0.pk3
	are identical, but I finally recognized that there was
	a missionpack/pak1.pk3 not in the final install - left over 
	from an earlier update from id. Doesn't seem to affect the
	DLL based runs at all.
	Note: I still do not have the final CD snapshot Robert
	promised me mid last week, they haven't even fixed the
	FTP account they took down. Communication with id is as
	abyssmal as ever.

	\\\\\\\* code/game/q\\\\\\\_shared.h: Q3\\\\\\\_VERSION "Q3 Team Arena Demo 1.27b"
	plus Com\\\\\\\_Memset, Com\\\\\\\_Memcpy, CIN\\\\\\\_shader, COM\\\\\\\_Compress.
	\\\\\\\* code/game/g\\\\\\\_main.c: Cvar change only
	\\\\\\\* code/game/ai\\\\\\\_dmq3.c: $SOS$.

	code changed after verifying the patch succeeded.

	\\\\\\\* code/cgame/cg\\\\\\\_event.c: fixed reject (REJECT).
	\\\\\\\* code/botlib/: all \\\\\\\*.rej here due to SOS/CVS $Keyword$.
	TODO: preserve SOS comments/rev history somehow.

	\\\\\\\* Patch: patching up to demo source.
	ln -s sos001122-demo work

	\\\\\\\* CVS: going to check in this snapshot and tag it as
	  cvs tag id1-26w-loki001207
	to prepare for upgrading to RC4. I have already made
	many more changes than I wanted to w/o getting any 
	closer to pinpointing the problem, I might as well
	patch up to id's more current sources.

	\\\\\\\* code/botlib/be\\\\\\\_interface.c: initialize by memset. Turns
	out that this fails in Export\\\\\\\_BotLibSetup on BotSetupWeaponAI
	loading "weapons.c" (from the pak, presumably) with an unknown
	structure field number. Mismatch of datafiles vs. source again.
	
	TODO: id replaced memsets in later source.
	TODO: have memsets on all exports and imports.

	\\\\\\\* SOS: RC4 source should be tagged "1.27g RC4" (raduffy).
	Unfortunately the Linux client doesn't care a bit. Show
	History does work if from/to date differ by at least a
	day, and it shows the tag on code/ (only that subtree),
	but recursive get aborts halfway.

### 2000-12-05  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* code/renderer/tr\_mesh.c: added assert there.
\* TEST: menus and in-game drawing are just as they were with
the initial SOS001119 port. In addition:
R\_AddMD3Surfaces: no such frame 0 to -2147483477
for 'models/players/xaero/upper.md3'
R\_AddMD3Surfaces: no such frame -2147483477 to 171
R\_AddMD3Surfaces: no such frame 171 to -2147483498
ad nauseam (used as my player model).
Triggered: haveing a trRefEntity\_t \*) 0x41dbbd00 with
frame = -2147483477. Might be a red herring (PRINT\_DEVELOPER),
ignore for now.

\\\* code/ui/ui\\\_main.c: missing return.
\\\* code/ui/ui\\\_shared.c: excess byte in initializer (which gcc
did not caught, but LCC did). Also LCC complains about
missing returns, but gcc doesn't (neither says unreacheable
code though). If necessary (MsVC?) guard with Q3\\\_VM.

\\\\\\\* code/q3\\\\\\\_ui/ui\\\\\\\_ingame.c: see below.
	\\\\\\\* code/q3\\\\\\\_ui/ui\\\\\\\_atoms.c: voidfunc\\\\\\\_f. LCC warns about conversion 
	from `pointer to void' to `pointer to void function(void)' 
	being compiler dependent. Casting NULL. Guess what, doesn't fix 
	it either.
	TODO: do not use these cursed scripts to generate VM code,
	we do not have proper rules for LCC/q3asm, thus the files never
	get updated.

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile: for paranoia's sake recreated the 1.17
	compile for the UI DLL (where only q\\\\\\\_shared/math were actually
	compiled as DO\\\\\\\_SHLIB\\\\\\\_CC.
	Later: switched to different gcc. 

	\\\\\\\* STATIC: remaining problems are vmMain (same entry point for all
	DLL's), could use cgMain, uiMain and gMain here for HARD\\\\\\\_LINKED. 
	Note: I don't think id has used this in ages.
	Plus all the collisions in \\\\\\\*\\\\\\\_syscalls.c, which simply can't be
	fixed cheaply. None is the superset of 2 others, neither seems
	w/o overlap to others. Full stop.

	\\\\\\\* code/botlib/be\\\\\\\_aas\\\\\\\_move.c: see below.
	\\\\\\\* code/game/ai\\\\\\\_dmq3.c: VEC\\\\\\\_UP/DOWN, MOVEDIR\\\\\\\_UP/DOWN now static.
	See also game/g\\\\\\\_utils.c for existing static duplicates.

	\\\\\\\* code/game/q\\\\\\\_shared.h: #define stricmp strcasecmp 
	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile:  no mo'  -Dstricmp=strcasecmp, see q\\\\\\\_shared.h
	Also: no mo'  -I/usr/include/glide, no FX
	TODO: are we building against system GL headers? ../Mesa/?

	\\\\\\\* code/q3\\\\\\\_ui/ui\\\\\\\_atoms.c: comment on duplication
	\\\\\\\* code/cgame/cg\\\\\\\_drawtools.c: use UI/CGAME\\\\\\\_HARD\\\\\\\_LINKED on UI duplicates 
	TODO: does this UI\\\\\\\_ code in cg\\\\\\\_drawtools/ui\\\\\\\_atoms belong into ui\\\\\\\_shared?

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile: use -DQ3\\\\\\\_STATIC 
	\\\\\\\* code/game/q\\\\\\\_shared.h (\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\_HARD\\\\\\\_LINKED): trigger on Q3\\\\\\\_STATIC 
	Later: collision between UI and CGAME is still there. This fixed
	the Com\\\\\\\_Error, Com\\\\\\\_Printf issues though

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile ($(B)/q3static/ai\\\\\\\_vcmd.o): this file was
	missing, hence undefined symbol.
	($(B)/baseq3/game/ai\\\\\\\_vcmd.o): same here.
	($(B)/missionpack/game/ai\\\\\\\_vcmd.o): same here.

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile (DEBUG\\\\\\\_CFLAGS): use ZONE\\\\\\\_DEBUG.

	\\\\\\\* code/qcommon/common.c: replaced malloc with calloc calls.

	\\\\\\\* code/q3\\\\\\\_ui/ui\\\\\\\_local.h: have to use ui/ui\\\\\\\_public.h
	\\\\\\\* code/cgame/cg\\\\\\\_servercmds.c: requires ../ui/menudef.h

	\\\\\\\* code/cgame/cg\\\\\\\_consolecmds.c: ui/ui\\\\\\\_shared.h is unique.
	\\\\\\\* code/q3\\\\\\\_ui/ui\\\\\\\_public.h: make sure this won't be compiled.	
	\\\\\\\* code/client/client.h: we have to include ui/ui\\\\\\\_public.h.
	Note: id is obviously maintaing only the ui/ headers, so the
	headers in q3\\\\\\\_ui/ are deprecated.

	\\\\\\\* code/unix/Makefile: cleanly separate B/baseq3/ and
	B/missionpack/ subtrees during build. While new and old
	UI are in separate directories, the cgame/ and game/
	are shared, with conditional -DMISSIONPACK compile
	and different files includeds (cd\\\\\\\_draw, cg\\\\\\\_newdraw).
	That means twice the number of targets (3 DLL's, 3 QVM's,
	times two), and different build rules.

	\\\\\\\* CVS:  ui/, code/ui, botfiles/ and subdirectories are added.
	The code/macosx/ directory turned out to be a real pain that

	that was done on the branch (code-sos/ prefix in files).
	The cvs update of this will be tagged with
	 cvs tag id1-26y-loki001119
	Use this tag to hunt for possible Linux fixes that got lost
	(i.e. got dropped by id since id000516 and were thus not in
	sos001119, but did not show in diff id000516 cvs1-17).

### 2000-11-30  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* TEST: compiled using the symbolic link ui/ -> q3\_ui/.
Had to undo one CVS change, regarding
code/cgame/cg\_syscalls.asm
code/game/g\_syscalls.asm
code/q3\_ui/ui\_syscalls.asm
These files are neither generated by Win32 cgame.bat
nor cgame.sh (etc.), thus seemingly maintained by hand.
cvs tag pr1-17-loki001130b
should be used if somebody needs this 1.17 snapshot
(which, remember, is post-release, with additional fixes).
Later:
cvs tag pr1-17-loki001130c
includes the full ChangeLog (duh).

\\\* CVS: up until cvs-1.17-001130, code/ui/ contained the
Q3 code for the UI QVM/DLL. In Q3TA, this code has been
moved to code/q3\\\_ui/, while at the same time the new
(scripting driven) UI code for Q3TA was maintained in
code/ui/. To preserve the history of code/ui/, it has been
renamed to q3/ui/ in the CVSROOT.
Note: this will BREAK all cvs-1.17 and before checkouts.
To compile earlier versions, move or link q3\\\_ui/ to ui/.
The code has been tagged
cvs tag pr1-17-loki001130
after the change.
DONE: remove code/\\\*/vm/\\\*.asm from CVSROOT
Note: this includes code/\\\*/\\\*.asm files (from \\\*\\\_syscalls.c).
These were originally tracked in CVS, but if we need
comparison of q3asm output or QVM files we can rely
on the Win32 and Linux SDK now. These files have been
physically removed from CVS now, followed by
cvs tag pr1-17-loki001130a





### 2000-11-30  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)      \*\*\* MISSIONPACK \*\*\*

\* RC2: new ZIP file (another 360M for convenience).

\\\* SOS: new CVS module, Quake3\\\_sos. This will be used to track
the unchanged SOS checkouts from id. As their repository
is read-only, and there is no estimate on when changes might
be backpropagated there, I will track their changes in a
separate module, and update our local Quake3 module
accordingly. This is effectively "tracking 3rd party"
w/o import and half-automated, forced mergers - in other
words, we now branch starting with our post-1.17 changes,
for the benefit of moving at all.
Baseline is a slightly changed PR-1.17 id000516 source dump
(essentially ui/ moved to q3\\\_ui for continuity, and CR/LF etc.).
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos id000516 pr1-17-win32
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001119 pr1-26-win32
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001120 pr1-26-win32-001120
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001121 pr1-26-win32-001121
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001122 pr1-26-win32-001122
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001122-demo pr1-26-win32-demo
This is about the 1.26w Team Arena Win32 demo release, give or
take a couple of lines. Has Q3\\\_VERSION "Q3 Team Arena Demo 1.27b".
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001123 pr1-26-win32-001123
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001126 pr1-26-win32-001126
Now track id versions (see code/game/q\\\_shared.h:Q3\\\_VERSION)
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001128 pr1-27c-win32-001128
With 1.27d they switched from Demo to full version (RC1).
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001129 pr1-27d-win32-001129
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001130a pr1-27d-win32-001130a
Now switched to 1.27e. This import is done from the SOS
working directory.
cvs import Quake3\\\_sos sos001130b pr1-27e-win32-001130b
Note: SoS created rwx attributes which are luckily fixed
automagically during import. It is also seemingly incapable
to compare files, and leave files that have not changed the
hell alone. I can't do cvs update due to the $..$ tags in
the original files (which CVS can't be told to ignore),
so I have to do import (creating a load of vendor tagged
branches), but at least cvsweb and cvs get the revisions
right.

\\\\\\\* code-sos/unix/Makefile: added linux\\\\\\\_joystick
	\\\\\\\* code-sos/unix/linux\\\\\\\_local.h: match mac/ and win32/, for prototypes.

	\\\\\\\* code-sos/unix/linux\\\\\\\_joystick.c: new file, code from linux\\\\\\\_glimp.c
	Note: decided to separate this, as (a) we might edit/extend
	a lot, (b), it's not in the id tree, (c) it's not GL, (d)
	there might be even more oddball devices. Anything that
	cuts down on diffs.

	\\\\\\\* code-sos/unix/linux\\\\\\\_glimp.c (Q\\\\\\\_stristr): const return (cvs1.17).
	Also (XLateKey): added more keyboard mappings (ASCII on
	upper row digits) (cvs1.17). Added in the minimal joystick
	hooks (cvars, function calls). Fixed joystick cvar naming
	to match win32 (kept joystick\\\\\\\_threshold). 
	TODO: joystick stubs for dedicated?

	\\\\\\\* CVS: I have to move up to 1.27d (data, Win32 networking).
	With exception of linux\\\\\\\_glimp.c (mostly joystick code), 
	all cvs1.17 changes should now be in the work snapshot 
	based on the first sos001119 we got from id. There are
	also some additional changes in there already, thus I'll
	move the (buggy) 1.26 snapshot into CVS before adding even
	more differences.





















### 2000-11-29  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)     \*\*\* MISSIONPACK \*\*\*

\* RC1: TeamArena\_Q3A\_RC1.zip. Source has moved from
Q3VERSION "Q3 Team Arena Demo 1.27c" to "Q3 1.27d" now.

\\\* code-sos/qcommon/common.c: added Com\\\_InitPushEvent(). Also
increased MAX\\\_PUSHED\\\_EVENTS to 256.
Note: this is another case of buffer memory not zero'ed.
Com\\\_EventLoop, fixed evTime to evType in debug print.

	Note: in CVS this fix is in ui/ui\\\\\\\_demo2.c. CVS is screwed by

	TODO: manual intervention on "ui goes q3\\\\\\\_ui"  in CVSROOT?
	\\\\\\\* renderer/qgl.h: see below (\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\_FX\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\_ guards).
	\\\\\\\* qcommon/files.c: migrated in the 1.17cvs changes against the
	id000516 code dump, i.e. the (not marked - boo hiss) mkv changes.
	Note: all the above is based on a diff of the last id code dump
	pre-1.17 against our CVS, with those fixes now migrated into the
	sos1.26 snapshot.
	TODO: move in joystick code.
	TODO: replace XAutoRepeatOn/Off with filter (focus).
	TODO: DGA 2.0 and such.
	
	\\\\\\\* code-sos/game/q\\\\\\\_shared.c: valid compare for NULL strings
	\\\\\\\* code-sos/unix/unix\\\\\\\_main.c: QRTLD, and now using RTLD\\\\\\\_NOW.
	Note: it is a bad idea to load game DLL's that are missing symbols.

	\\\\\\\* code-sos/game/g\\\\\\\_main.c: see below.
	\\\\\\\* code-sos/q3\\\\\\\_ui/ui\\\\\\\_main.c: see below.
	\\\\\\\* code-sos/cgame/cg\\\\\\\_main.c: made cvarTable and cvarTableSize static. This resolved
	a segfault related to traversing the UI table during Init.
	Note: there is a segfault related to this variable being out of bounds. 
	Different struct size in global variables possible aliasing between the 
	DLL's.
	
	\\\\\\\* code-sos/unix/unix\\\\\\\_main.c (Sys\\\\\\\_Error): assert(0), no exit in debug.
	\\\\\\\* code-sos/game/q\\\\\\\_shared.c: now aborts on NULL destination. Also DPrintf's
	on bogus excess copies.

        331             ptr = botimport.GetMemory(size + sizeof(unsigned long int));
	as botimport is completely NULL'ed.

	\\\\\\\* code-sos/q3\\\\\\\_ui/q3\\\\\\\_ui.sh: created from ui/ui.sh 1.17 

	\\\\\\\* code-sos/q3\\\\\\\_ui/q3\\\\\\\_ui.q3asm: unfubared (CR/LF, / path).

	\\\\\\\* code-sos/unix/Makefile: added q3\\\\\\\_ui/ make targets (basically
	ui/ targets from CVS 1.17 Makefile for starters).

	\\\\\\\* code-sos/q3\\\\\\\_ui/: this is the old UI code, which does not use
	../ui/menus.txt (see ui/ui\\\\\\\_main.c). In other words,
	the code in ui/ now has to be compiled or qvm'ed 
	for missionpack/, but to create the necessary DLL or
	QVM modules for baseq3/ we need to use q3\\\\\\\_ui/.

\* code/unix/Makefile: now expects a run/ directory
relative (between this, the Loki standards, and the
utility code in the same repository, it's ever so
slightly less dorky).
TODO: fix broken copyfiles target etc.pp.

\\\* code/game/bg\\\_lib.c: turns out the changes I
undid 001120 were affecting original Zoid
Linux port related defines, which break VM
compile. Mike fixed those (which I unfixed
when referring to the latest id code that does
not contain these patches). However, they
duplicate ANSI libc symbols, so the guards might
be wrong. The symbols are missing when compiling
for VM, so I now use the existing lcc -DQ3\\\_VM
flag:
//#if !defined ( \\\_MSC\\\_VER ) \\\&\\\& ! defined ( \\\_\\\_linux\\\_\\\_ )
#if defined ( Q3\\\_VM )
This will break DLL compile on non-ANSI platforms,
which will have to be added to the conditional then.

	even. Got it to compile, link and start, but it's currently broken
	(menu doesn't render in full, can't get into game etc.). Need
	a baseline 1.17 to diff against. Last code dump was May 16, with 
	bspc code updated May 19. Checking working directory of bk000520
	against CVS next (Mike's fixes never made it into id's codebase
	or a post 1.17 release, neither did my fixes as released in the
	point release version 1.17).

### 2000-06-30  Michael Vance [briraeos@lokigames.com](mailto:briraeos@lokigames.com)

\* misc: Spoke with Leonardo about qvm mess.

\\\* ui/ui.sh: Created to build much like the ui.bat script.

\\\\\\\* ui/ui.q3asm: Use linux style paths.

	\\\\\\\* game/game.sh: Created to build much like the game.bat script.

	\\\\\\\* game/game.q3asm: Use linux style paths.

	\\\\\\\* cgame/cgame.sh: Created to build much like the cgame.bat script.

	\\\\\\\* cgame/cgame.q3asm: Use linux systel paths.

	\\\\\\\* unix/Makefile: Use the new .sh scripts to build the QVM files.

	\\\\\\\* lcc/etc/linux.c: Build .asm files instead of .s files.

	\\\\\\\* misc: QVMs now load properly, with minor glitches that should
	hopefully be solvable. The new build scripts conflict with the
	.asm files already in CVS, as the generated byte code is slightly
	different in some cases.
	









### 2000-06-29  Michael Vance [briareos@lokigames.com](mailto:briareos@lokigames.com)

\* lcc/makefile: Tweaked to automatically include the system
compiler's header location. Added an install directory.

\\\* lcc/custom.mk: Added a build directory.

\\\\\\\* lcc/etc/linux.c: Numerous small tweaks to make compiling the VM
	code a much simpler task.

	\\\\\\\* q3asm/Makefile: Created.

	\\\\\\\* q3asm/q3asm.c: Fixed uninitialized variable in
	HashString(). Fixed off by one in argument parsing.
	
	\\\\\\\* misc: Had Brian remove the Xmd.h include from glx.h so that we can
	build Quake3 on XFree86 4.0 systems.

	\\\\\\\* wine: Attempted to build with lcc.exe and q3asm.exe using wine,
	also did not work. This is in contrast to MikeP's .qvms, which
	seem to work.
	









### 2000-06-28  Michael Vance [briareos@lokigames.com](mailto:briareos@lokigames.com)

\* common/files.c: Fixed Mods menu behaviour.

\\\* unix/linux\\\_qgl.c: Guarded references to fxMesa.

\\\\\\\* renderer/qgl.h: Guarded references to fxMesa.

	\\\\\\\* ui/ui\\\\\\\_demo2.c: Don't convert filename to uppercase.
	









### 2000-05-07  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* common/cmdlib.c: windowism, not guarded. Added WIN32 around "ATOM a".

\\\* q3map/Makefile: Linux Makefile.

\\\\\\\* q3map/Makefile.irix: "makefile" in original code, Irix-only Makefile. 
	Just fixed some redundant TAB that GNU make despises about as much as I 
	despise GNU Make, and changed to a relative path.










### 2000-05-01  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* q3radiant/: updated with Q3Radiant198b3-src.zip.
Tagged (globally) as q3radiant-198b3.
Kept the old files
3DFXCamWnd.h
3DFXCamWnd.cpp
MainFrm2.cpp
New files
Shaders.h
misc/      (contributed special TGA resources, don't relly belong)
Removed:
pName
Changed filenames to previous case:
UNNAMED.MAP           -> unnamed.map
RES/BMP0002.BMP       -> RES/bmp00002.bmp
Changed:
changelog.txt         -> ChangeLog



### 2000-04-28  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* CVS: bk000425 modified sources. This replaces the unix/ directory
which is not yet in id's SourceSafe. Two check-ins, due to minor
changes in an attempt to nail the Voodoo3 related crashes (driver
problems, not a Q3 issue). Undid some of the QFL changes for PI
and the log bug fix - put back in (TODO). Also includes:
\* Quake3/code/botlib/be\_aas\_sample.c: single file update from Robert.

\\\* CVS: id000423 code dumps (two of them). Applying Loki patches.
Tagged for the final version (all patches).

\\\\\\\* CVS: id000422 code dump. This did not include the 1.16n fixes
	used for Linux, and was the first dump for the 1.17 security fix
	release.
	Note: forgot to check in the ft2/ headers themselves, but they
	are not used in the current codebase anyway. Are added in next
	dump. Also there is use of CVS/CVS-like $Keyword$ patterns in
	some files, and between their revisions and ours we fuck this up.
	Also, id ZIP files create write protected sources, have to do
	chmod -R a+w Quake3/ to work and overwrite files.

	\\\\\\\* CVS: bk000315 modified source. This version was the 1.16n release.
	Note: the changes applied here are not in the subsequent code dumps
	of id. If you want to compile the Linux version as released you
	have to use bk-tagged versions until the patches are merged in by
	Robert Duffy.

	\\\\\\\* CVS: id000314 engine code dump, same procedure as below, tag.
	Note: this version added vm/ sudirectories with assembly files
	for cgame, game, ui. CVS tag id000314.

	\\\\\\\* CVS: id000304 engine code dump. Now there is a problem, as CVS
	was used in the Mac sources. Do
	  find . -name 'CVS' -exec rm -r {} \\\\\\\\;
        before cvs update, then tagged:
	 cvs -d /loki/cvsroot/ tag id000304 Quake3/

	\\\\\\\* CVS: checked in a source snapshot of the id00303 engine code
	and the id0003029 tools code. The tool sources are not fully in 
	sync, and we have only partial source from earlier engine revisions.
        The engine source marks where Loki took over from Dave Kirsch.
        This snapshot (with all temporary and bogus files) is imported
        and tagged using:
          cvs -d /loki/cvsroot import Quake3 id000303 initial

        Modules:
          code:      the Q3 engine code, including a jpeg-6/ copy
          common:    code shared by tools
          libs:      code shared by tools, including a jpeg6/ copy
          q3asm:     VM bytecode assembly 
          q3data:    misc. Q3 data conversions
          q3map:     BSP builder
          q3radiant: Win32 editor, as is
          lcc:       C compiler for q3asm

        The sources have not been cleaned up, and binary files have not been
	removed. The Q3Radiant code base might exhibit mixed case asmbiguities
	in the future, and future source dumps might come from SourceForge
	instead.










### 2000-04-25  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* q3code.id000425/unix/Makefile: relative path, relocatable.
Note: first code merge with id, finally :-).



### 2000-04-24  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* q3code.bk000422/unix/matha.s: in C(BoxOnPlaneSide)
the following line triggers assembler warning:
"missing prefix `\*' in absolute indirect address, maybe misassembled!"
jmp Ljmptab(,%eax,4)



\\\* q3code.bk000422/unix/Makefile (MOUNT\\\_DIR): rember to change.
TODO: fix this bloody Makefile to be relocatable, damnit.

\\\\\\\* q3code.bk000422/cgame/cg\\\\\\\_event.c: applied JCash fix again
	(see EV\\\\\\\_EVENT\\\\\\\_BITS below). Send e-mail to verify.

	\\\\\\\* q3code.bk000422/renderer/tr\\\\\\\_image.c: "../jpeg-6/jpeglib.h" again.
	
	\\\\\\\* q3code.bk000422/: created from the id dump of today, lacking
	all but one of my changes (sigh). Swapped unix/ competely, takes
	care of 90%. Submitted all changes again to Robert...










### 2000-04-19  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* q3code.bk000315/unix/linux\_glimp.c (GLimp\_EndFrame):
QGL\_EnableLogging( r\_logFile->value ) doesn't work?

\\\* q3code.bk000315/unix/linux\\\_qgl.c:  GLimp\\\_LogNewFrame() is
obsolete. QGL\\\_EnableLogging was out of sync with Win32 and
did not support the new framecounter decrement logic.





### 2000-04-03  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* q3code.bk000315/server/sv\_snapshot.c: svs.nextSnapshotEntities
is a signed integer unconditionally incremented, which gets
negative and causes a segfaulting indexing an array. Added reset
to counter. Might fail if snapshot numbers are supposed to
monotonically increase.



### 2000-04-02  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* q3code.bk000315/client/cl\_parse.c (CL\_ParseServerMessage):
assert(0) on Illegible message (remember to +set in\_mouse 0).
TODO: have to add a dump message function, it's unreadable.

\\\* botlib/be\\\_ai\\\_goal.c (InitLevelItemHeap): loop counter -2
left -2 with uninitialized next, and -1 disconnected. Removed
redundant memset. There is an item alloc leak I suspect, as
max\\\_levelitems 1024 merely delayed the overflow error.





### 2000-04-01  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* botlib/be\_ai\_goal.c (InitLevelItemHeap): still segfaults.
Not memsetting the entire item heap. As items are cleared
on return, that leaves only memory corruption?
Later: upped max\_levelitems from 256 to 1024
Later: client dies on connect:
Error: CL\_ParseServerMessage: Illegible server message 255





### 2000-03-31  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* botlib/be\_ai\_goal.c: initializing global vars.
Segfault in AllocLevelItem ()
at /home/bk/Games/Quake3/q3code/botlib/be\_ai\_goal.c:364
I suspect that the initial freelevelitems setting is at
the end of the list and eventually exposed.

\\\* cgame/cg\\\_event.c: according to Johmn Cash:
itemNum = (es->event \\\& \\\~EV\\\_EVENT\\\_BITS) - EV\\\_USE\\\_ITEM0
Quote: "This causes itemNum to be invalid about half the time,
preventing any client side effect tied to the item from occurring."





### 2000-03-06  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* qcommon/common.c: set pushEvent buffer and indices
to zero in Com\_Init().

\\\* q3code/qcommon/qcommon.h: made SE\\\_NONE (and for paranoia
also NA\\\_BOT) explicitely set to zero.





### 2000-02-27  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* unix/Makefile: added dmalloc in an attempt to get on
the Z\_Free bug. Futile. Despite stripping dmalloc debug
token down to essentials, I get a (seemingly bogus or
unrelated):
debug-malloc library: dumping program, fatal error
Error: possibly bad .c filename pointer (err 24)





### 2000-02-26  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* qcommon/common.c: various debug builts to isolate the
Z\_Free bug. It reproducibly happens on some machines
with SE\_PACKET, but the packets themselves look
thoroughly corrupted.



### 2000-02-21  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* qcommon/common.c (Com\_EventLoop): possible problem
here, pointer does not get cleared.

\\\* unix/linux\\\_glimp.c (InitSig): no signal handler.
\\\* common/common.c: dump in Com\\\_Error for debug.





### 2000-02-17  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* q3code: new dump from Zoid. Repeat tr\_image.c fix.

\\\* unix/Makefile: added client/snd\\\_adpcm.c (linkage errors).
Later: added entire JPDIR and rules, for tr\\\_image.c.
Later: had to fix fules for game/ai\\\_\\\*.c files.
Later: removed ui/ui\\\_quit.o (n/a)
Later: took out -mpentiumpro -march=pentiumpro

\\\\\\\* renderer/tr\\\\\\\_image.c: windowism in #include path (see below).
         #include "..\\\\\\\\jpeg-6\\\\\\\\jpeglib.h"










### 1999-12-27  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* Alpha: tried a dedicated server compile. Segfaults in
../qcommon/files.c:1682, a paksort function doing pointer
fiddling.

\\\* Makefile.alpha: created.
Note: want to take the SDL/Setup autoconf ASAP.

\\\\\\\* unix/unix\\\\\\\_main.c: fixed \\\\\\\_\\\\\\\_axp\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\_ to \\\\\\\_\\\\\\\_alpha\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\_, guarded
	\\\\\\\_FPU\\\\\\\_SETCW.

	\\\\\\\* qcommon/vm\\\\\\\_alpha.c: dummy, created.
	\\\\\\\* qcommon/vm\\\\\\\_null.c: dummy, created.










### 1999-12-04  Bernd Kreimeier  [bk@lokigames.com](mailto:bk@lokigames.com)

\* renderer/tr\_image.c: windowism in #include path.
#include "..\\jpeg-6\\jpeglib.h"

\\\* Revision 1.11: from Zoid by e-mail.
Note: threw away my playground copy, starting with the
ZIP file. Zoid's using CVS now, but we can't remote
access it. Thus did the
"find . -name 'CVS' -exec rm -rf {} \\\\;"
and then track it as 3rd party source by



\\\\\\\* ChangeLog: created. Now starting to track Q3A source.
